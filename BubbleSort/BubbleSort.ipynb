    "## How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble sort algorithm uses two for loops to sort an array of n elements. First for loop will iterate from first element to second-to-last element. For every iterations of first loop second for loop is going to iterate from last element to one element after element which pointing first for loop which mean that with every new ietration of first loop second loop is going to make one less iteration then previous iteration. When second loop is finished that means that algorithm set right element on position on which first loop pointing. \n",

    "2) If(5 < 2) no: continue with next iteration: j = 2\n",

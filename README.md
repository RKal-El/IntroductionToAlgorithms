# Introduction to Algorithms
Can't find implementations of algorithms and data structures teached in popular book Introduction to Algorithms, you came at right place.
(https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)

Algorithms and data structures are implemented in python trough the open-source web application jupyter notebook.

7) Check options:  Associate files with Python, Create shortcuts for installed applications, Add Python to environment variables
8) If you are satisfied with location of installation click Install

Now we are going to install jupyter notebook:
